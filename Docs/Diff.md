# Diff Tool Documentation

CuteCI uses ``cuteci-diff`` to create diffs from the screenshots generated by ``libcuteci``.

## Usage

```
cuteci-diff [summary/html] [folderA] [folderB]
```

*Arguments:*

* ``[summary/html]`` - The output format to use. ``summary`` will produce a short changelog while ``html`` generates a table outlining the changes between ``folderA`` and ``folderB``
* ``[folderA]`` - One of the two folders containing screenshots to be compared (*Before*)
* ``[folderB]`` - One of the two folders containing screenshots to be compared (*After*)

## Caveats

* Neither ``folderA`` nor ``folderB`` are allowed to be empty.
* Currently ``cuteci-diff`` can only compare uncompressed 24-bit Bitmaps with a ``.bmp`` file extension.
